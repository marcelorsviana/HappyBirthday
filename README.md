### Description of the app:


It was created an app that shows a _happy birthday_ message, an _image_ and a _signature_.

### Details from its development:

✔️ An image was imported to the _res > drawable_ folder.

✔️ It was used a _ConstraintLayout_ and inside it were added a imageView, which is the background image, and two textViews: one for the _"happy birthday, Sam"_ message and another one for the _signature_.

✔️ The imageView was placed first in the component tree, so the other views can be seen.

✔️ Texts were turned into strings, so it's easier to make a translated version of the app.

✔️ Some text decorations were added to the textViews.
